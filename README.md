# NewerSMLostLands

## Summary

You're probably wondering what is that, right ?

Oh, actually you're not.... oh well.

Basically, a loooong time ago, I was making a project called <i>Newer Super Mario Lost Lands</i>, but cancelled it for various reasons.

The thing is, I made custom code for it based on the [NewerSMBW Source Code](https://github.com/Newer-Team/NewerSMBW), but I only released it on some semi-private illegal GDrive folder, which isn't the best idea of the world so I imported the repo to github for anyone to watch !

## Disclaimer

This code is here so people wanting it can use it, BUT do not expect quality not working code !

This project is very old, and back then I was an even worse programmer than I am today, so this code looks AWFUL, barely works and is here only if people want to use pieces from it.

## Credits

<b>This section is very important:

If you use ANY code from here that wasn't in the original [NewerSMBW Source Code](https://github.com/Newer-Team/NewerSMBW) for one of your mods or whatever, you MUST credit:</b>

-[Grop](https://github.com/TheGrop), for his help on the translations support, the "powerlayout" hack, some misc. stuff, helping me setupping IDA & taught me how to use it, and also for being one of the only NSMBW programmer who actively supported me and helped me even though I was a complete idiot (and I still am to be honest, but I'm less of an idiot than I was in 2019)

-[RoadRunnerWMC](https://github.com/RoadRunnerWMC), for his help on translations support

-[CLF78](https://github.com/CLF78), for his help on the hurry up SFX thing

<b>I'm asking you not to credit me (RedStoneMatt) though, for various reasons.</b>

If anyone remembers helping me with the code, feel free to DM me on discord so I can add you to the list !
